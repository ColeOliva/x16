# x16

if you open one of the folders, you will probably see a mess of files. In my defense, I'm a college student plagued by stress. Because I'm adding this to my github almost a year after coding it, I had to refresh my memory 
on essentially every file in here and what it does, because if you don't have explicit directions, then it won't work very well. 

To give a rundown, the entirety of this program (with a focus on x16, xas, and xod files) mimics a 16 bit computer, written in C and assembly (for the assembler... it was not fun.). Complete with an instruction set and everything. If you want more details, look at the attached
pdfs I have provided for the entirety of the assignment.

to run, go to the 'final' folder. run ```make```, ```make xas```, ```make x16```, and ```make xod```. to play the maze game, run ```./x16 rogue.obj```. to play 2048, run ```./x16 2048.obj```. for both games, 
follow the instructions on the terminal, and then ctrl-c to exit. Full disclosure - while I did do the brunt of the coding, the games themselves were not coded by me (although I am fascinated by what's going on
behind the scenes).

If you have any questions, feel free to let me know. I'm happy to take a deeper dive into what's going on.
